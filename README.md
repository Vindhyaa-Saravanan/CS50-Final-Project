_THE IDEA_
When I got down to thinking about what to present as my CS50 Final Project, I knew I wanted to make something simple, but something that would still showcase my progress before and after the course.
After all, the course’s motto is “what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began”.
Having become a big fan of web programming, I decided to create a Recipe Website.

_THE PROCESS_
I decided to create a classy homepage for my website.
The site features a number of files for each section and subsection of the entire website, such as the homepage, as well as homepages for the individual cuisines involved.
My HTML files for each page make use of a variety of HTML tags.
Design and neatness of my webpage was key.
Writing and testing CSS rules was the best part of the entire project.

_WHAT I’VE LEARNT FROM THE PROJECT_
I learnt a lot from writing and implementing my very first CS project.
Firstly, implementing different tools such as the Carousel from Bootstrap taught me that there was a lot more for me to learn and master.
Writing different HTML and CSS files for different webpages made me realize how much work goes into creating each of the wonderfully complex and well-designed pages we interact with each day.
Lastly, this project also taught me the value of good webpage design.
